\subsection{Supporting Non-zero Boundary Conditions}

Supporting non-zero boundary conditions would require us to change Equation 7 to

\begin{equation}
  (\underline{TU} + \underline{UT})i,j = h^2f_{i,j} + \underline U = \underline{G}
\end{equation}



\subsection{Generalizing to Rectangular Domains}
Generalizing this implementation to rectangular domains has no effect on the
method. The only difference would thus be the grid. As such, the only difference
in the implementation is that the transposing has to be explicit grid
dimensions, and that one uses the rectangular width and rectangular height
properly at correct positions.
