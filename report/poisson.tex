\section{The Poisson Problem}

Poisson's equation is defined as

\begin{align}
  - \nabla ^2 u &= f &\text{in~} \Omega \\
  u &= 0 &\text{on~} \partial\Omega
\end{align}
where $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian, the second order differential
operator. {\em u} and {\em f} are both real- or complex-valued functions on a
manifold, in our case the Euclidian space.

We discretize this problem on a uniform, finite, difference grid with a mesh
spacing $h = 1/n$.
