\section{The Poisson Problem}

Poisson's equation is defined as

\begin{align}
  - \nabla ^2 u &= f &\text{in~} \Omega \\
  u &= 0 &\text{on~} \partial\Omega
\end{align}
where $\nabla^2$ is the Laplacian, the second order differential
operator. {\em u} and {\em f} are both real- or complex-valued functions on a
manifold, in our case the Euclidian space.

We discretize this problem on a uniform, finite, difference grid with a mesh
spacing $h = 1/n$. To obtain the second derivative, one approximate $u$ by using
the 5-point stencil. The problem can thus be expressed as

\begin{equation}
  -\cfrac{u_{i+1, j} + u_{i, j+1} +u_{i-1, j} +u_{i, j-1} - 4u_{i, j}}{h^2} =
  f_{i,j}
\end{equation}

where $f_{i,j} = f(x_i, y_j)$ and $u_{i,j} \approx u(x_i, y_j)$, the
approximation.

Now, our problem is reduced to find a solution to

\begin{equation}
  \underline A \underline u = \underline f
\end{equation}

where $\underline A$ represents the discrete Laplace operator, $\underline u$ is
a vector representing the unknowns, and $\underline f$ is a known right hand
side vector.
